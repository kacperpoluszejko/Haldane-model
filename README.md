# Haldane Model Simulation üß†

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **Haldane model** ‚Äî a tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice that exhibits a **quantum anomalous Hall effect (QAHE)** without an external magnetic field.  
The project allows you to explore topological properties of the system, such as the **energy band structure** and **Chern number**, by adjusting model parameters like on-site potential, hopping amplitudes, and phase factors.  

This code was created based on theory presented [here](link_do_publikacji_lub_materia≈Çu_teoretycznego).

## üß† Features

- Compute and visualize **energy bands** of the Haldane model.  
- Calculate the **Chern number** using Berry curvature integration.  
- Adjustable parameters:
  - nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hopping (ta, tb, tab)
  - on-site potential difference (M), 
- Option to display **edge states** for finite ribbons.
