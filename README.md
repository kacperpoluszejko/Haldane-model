# Haldane Model Simulation ðŸ§ 

This repository contains a Python implementation of the Haldane model â€” a tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice that exhibits a quantum anomalous Hall effect without an external magnetic field.
The project allows you to explore topological properties of the system, such as the energy band structure and Chern number, by adjusting model parameters like on-site potential, hopping amplitudes, and phase factors.
